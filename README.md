Course Outline
Acknowledgment Statement:UBC’s Point   Grey   Campus   is   located   on the traditional,   ancestral,   and unceded territory   of the xwməθkwəy̓   əm (Musqueam) people. The land it is situated on has always been a place of   learning for the Musqueam people, who   for   millennia   have   passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next   on   this   site.
Dynamic Analysis and Response of Structural Systems:
•      formulation   of   equation   of   motion
•      free vibrations and response to harmonic, periodic and transient loadings
•      response   to   impulsive   loadings   and   response   to   general   dynamic   loadings
•      numerical   evaluation   of   dynamic   response
•      earthquake   response   of   linear   and   nonlinear   systems
•      generalized SDOF   systems
•      frequency   domain   method   of   analysis
•      formulation   of   equations   of   motion   for   MODF   systems
•      free   vibration   of   MODF   systems
•      dynamic   analysis   and   response   of   MODF   systems
•      damping   in   structures

Course Schedule:
The course lectures will be delivered through one lecture per week on Monday between 2:00 to   5:00 p.m.   A   detailed schedule of   the course, including deliverable deadlines will be posted   on   Canvas   at the   start   of   the       course.Course Mark: 30% mid-term take-home exam, 40% final take-home exam   and   30%   for   a term paper. The   mid-   term exam will be held during the first week of   November, and the final take-home   exam will be held   during the exam   period   at   the   end   of   the   term.
The term paper is due the last day of   classes. The projects will be based on   chapters   1 to   12   of   Chopra’s book.
The practice problems shown on the last page do not need to be handed-in, but can be   submitted to the TA   for   review and marking.    Solutions to some of   the assigned problems will be   discussed   in   class.
